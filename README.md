# Echo State Network (ESN)

The Echo State Network (ESN) is a type of recurrent neural network that can effectively model and predict time series data. This implementation of the ESN is designed to handle arbitrary input and output dimensions, making it versatile for various applications.

## Features

- Arbitrary input and output dimensions: The ESN can handle time series data with different input and output dimensions, allowing flexibility in modeling various types of data.
- Reservoir initialization: The reservoir, which is the core of the ESN, can be initialized with random or predefined weights, giving control over the network dynamics.
- Training and prediction: The ESN can be trained using the provided training data and then used for making predictions on unseen data.
- Parameter tuning: The hyperparameters of the ESN, such as reservoir size, spectral radius, and leaky integration factor, can be adjusted to achieve optimal performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- scikit-learn (optional, for training the ESN)
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
